# A matching system game made with unity (v 5.2.2) #

It's a repository for a prototype made in 16 hours. Feel free to download, there isn't no license, no condition, just download it and use as you want. I hope this help you to study unity.

#### Features 

1. Grid (blocks) Generator.
3. UI (final and best score, next level and retry button).
4. Special items (bomb, firework and ice).
5. Juiciness (feel, screen shake and particles).
6. Music and sound effects.

#### Demo

Take a look on [WebGL live demo](https://rawgit.com/joaokucera/unity-matching-system/master/demo-webgl/index.html).

`How to play?`

- Click over blocks to match;
- Click over special items to use them;
